    <h1 id="koji-chamber" class='center-align'>Building a Koji Chamber</h1>

    <p>
    At the end of 2018 I picked up a copy of the <a href="https://amzn.to/2TndE2E">NOMA Fermentation Guide</a>
    and was absolutely blown away by the techniques used it. It’s part cookbook, part
    textbook, filled to the brim with insanely awesome technical information about
    how the various fermentation processes work. I quickly put together a koji
    chamber, and started fermenting away. After making lots of koji, much of which
    turned into misos and shoyus, some I bartered for discounts on new knives or a
    free bottle of wine, I moved from Oakland to NYC and sadly sold off my chamber
    to some person at Lagunitas. It took some time before I finally settled in, and
    re-sourced a new chamber. After DM’ing multiple people on reddit with the part
    list, I figured I should make a website with the list and various nuances.
    Disclaimer: For most parts I’m using an Amazon affiliate link. If you’re trying
    to reduce cost, there are more than likely cheaper options out there but keep in
    mind the criteria for why something was picked.
    </p>

    <h4 id="sheet-pan-rack">Sheet Pan Rack</h4>

    <p>
    First thing first, you need a container! I personally use a tray rack. It feels
    really versatile, especially since my girlfriend uses it when she bakes a lot
    of cookies. I can scale up the amount of koji being made at a time by just
    adding more trays. You’ll need to snag a vinyl cover and a tray for the bottom
    of the rack to act as the floor. Here&#39;s the link for the <a
        href="https://amzn.to/3bHWcw5">rack</a>, <a
        href="https://amzn.to/2zUW4Mw">vinyl cover</a>, and <a
        href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/advance-tabco-18-8a-26-full-size-18-gauge-aluminum-sheet-pan-wire-in-rim-18-x-26/109188A26.html">full
        sized tray</a>.
    </p>

    <h4 id="cooler">Cooler</h4>
    <p>
    A cooler is a great starting point as they’re relatively cheap. The main caveat
    is you need to keep the lid slightly open most of the time to let fresh air in.
    Something like this would probably work really well, but if you can go to a
    local walmart I imagine there’s even cheaper coolers to be had.
    Link to <a href="https://amzn.to/36fnb0V">Coleman cooler</a>.
    </p>
    <h4 id="perforated-tray">Perforated Tray</h4>

    <p>
    The perforation allows the <em>Aspergillus Oryzae</em> to breath. The hotel
    pans are really nice because it gives you some depth to work with, but a
    perforated sheet tray totally works. If you want to get fancy, you can build a
    traditional tray out of untreated cedar. I like half sized personally since
    they’re easier to handle and store. Links for the
    <a href="https://amzn.to/3e31xzE">perforated sheet pan</a> and
    <a href="https://amzn.to/3e2M1nv">2 1/2” deep hotel pan</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>N.B.:</strong> Sheet pans and hotel pans use fundamentally different
    sizing! A half sized hotel pan <strong>will not</strong> be able to use the
    rails in a sheet pan rack, as it&#39;s not wide enough. A full sized hotel pan
    will be too big. For some reason hotel pan racks are considerably more
    expensive than a sheet pan rack, so what I did was simply run some wood across
    the rails so the hotel pans can sit on them.
    </p>

    <h4 id="temperature-and-humidity-controller">Temperature and Humidity Controller</h4>
    <p>
    Because <em>Aspergillus Oryzae</em> needs to be incubated at approximately 30
    degrees Celsius and at 80% humidity, you’re going to need some temperature
    controllers. I think the InkBird controllers work super well, especially for
    the price point. One thing to keep in mind though is that they are not true PID
    controllers, meaning there will be some temperature error. It’ll let the
    temperature drop to, say, 29.5 degree before turning the heating element on,
    and then wait until the temperature is at 30 degrees before turning it off.
    Real, tuned PID controllers can keep the temperature at a consistent 30 degrees
    by constantly making micro adjustments. If you want, you can get nerdy and
    build one using an Arduino and buying the relevant sensors. Link to
    <a href="https://amzn.to/2XfHuHo">Inkbird Humidity and Temperature controller</a>.
    </p>

    <h4 id="heating-element">Heating Element</h4>
    <p>
    Per above, you’re going to need a heating element. The size of the chamber
    should dictate the wattage of heater you buy. I personally use a half sized
    tray rack, and find 500w keeps up pretty easily at room temp. Make sure you
    pick one with a physical on/off switch! If it’s not physical, your heater won’t
    turn on when your temperature controller starts providing power to it again.
    Link to <a href="https://amzn.to/3g9UQho">500 watt space heater</a>.</p>

    <h4 id="humidifier">Humidifier</h4>
    <p>
    Same idea goes for a humidifier. Physical switch is a must, and chamber size
    dictates the amount of water you need. This will keep my chamber at 80%
    humidity for the whole grow time without needing to be filled, which is really
    nice.
    Link to
    <a href="https://amzn.to/2z5oX93">humidifier w/ physicalswitch</a>. For a cooler setup,
    you could use a <a href="https://amzn.to/2LFxeTJ">heating mat</a> to save space.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you’re going to use a cooler instead of a rack style set up, you can
    probably use one of these
    <a href="https://amzn.to/2WMfnkg">small USB powered stick</a> humidifiers
    in glass of water to get some space back. I haven’t
    tried it though so buyer beware.
    </p>
    <p><b>N.B.:</b> Humidity and moisture will tend to collect on the side of your chamber.
    This will lead to incorrect humidity readings. To get more accurate readings, I
    highly recommend taping the cable to the top of chamber so that the hygrometer dangles in midair,
    as close to where your koji will be.
    </p>
    <h4> Putting it all together </h4>
    <p>
    Once you have all your pieces, set it up! It should be pretty intuitive,
    make sure you keep your cord managed. If you're using a cooler, you can use
    something like a few mason jar lids or cooling tray to keep the koji tray
    off the floor.
    </p>

    <h4> Other Readings </h4>
    <p>
      Since I've never made a cooler based fermentation chamber, I'd strongly recommend
      reading /u/nesevis's post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/9z97cv/guide_fermentation_chamber_for_noma_style_garums/">making a cooler chamber</a>.
